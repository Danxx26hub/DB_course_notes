SQL sample queries


select count(*) as num, species from animals group by species order by num desc;

will select and count in a num column all species in the zoo the group and order by desc.



Adding or inserting into a database you can either show the columns or decide not too.

insert into animals (name, species, birthdate) values ('Peggy', 'opossum', '2018-01-14');

insert into animals values ('Peggy', 'opossum', '2018-01-14');

using a join "shortcut"


select name from animals, diet where animals.species = diet.species and food = 'fish';

having is used to filter out numbers to count, do not use "where" 

example:

select species, count(*) as num from animals group by species having num = 1;

"where " is a restriction on the source tables
"having" is a restriction on the result after aggregation

another example of a join and count:

select food, count(*) as num from animals join diet on animals.species = diet.species group by food having num = 1;
